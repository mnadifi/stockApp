# Stock App 

This Stock App simulates a business app so that the user can keep track of additional stock items as they are added to the business. For this. the business owner notes that, for each stock item, he would need to have the following:

* Name: The name of the stock item to be added
* Description: A description of the stock item
* Price: How much the customer pays for the stock item
* Available Date: When this stock item is available within the store
* Taxable: Whether or not the stock item has tax applied when purchased

The user should be able to:
* View the existing stock items
* Add a new stock item (the data is being saved in the DOM)

**Note:** The App is responsive but for one break point only for Mobile Portrait mode.
